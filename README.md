[ ![Codeship Status for ngabor84/booking-api](https://app.codeship.com/projects/6e0dbaf0-2274-0135-9adb-62dd7db260b1/status?branch=master)](https://app.codeship.com/projects/221680)

## Description
This is a simple REST-API example application based on Laravel's Lumen framework, and built on the top of Dingo API.
I build it for self-training, because I think the best way to learn something new is to work with it.

This application is still in development!

## Requirements
- PHP >= 7.1
- Redis
- Mysql
- Sqlite (for testing)

## Main features
- Auto generated documentation (php artisan api:docs)
- Authentication with JWT
- Authorization with roles and permissions
- Caching
- Data transformation
- Formatted exceptions with http status codes
- Request validation
- Request query parsing (filtering, sorting, pagination, eager loading)
- Structured JSON format response
- Unit, integration, and e2e tests
- Versioning (via Accept header)
